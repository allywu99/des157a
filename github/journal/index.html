        <article><h1>Post #5: Game Design UX Best Practices Response
        </h1>
        <p>Hey there! I just read this awesome article on game design and UX best practices, and I wanted to share some of my thoughts with you.<br><br>

        The article does a great job of breaking down the key principles that game designers can use to create engaging and enjoyable experiences for users. One of the things that really stood out to me was the importance of creating a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the game. By using a consistent color palette, typography, and design language, designers can help users navigate the game and understand its mechanics more easily.<br><br>
            
        Another thing that the article touched on was the importance of making games accessible and inclusive to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This is such an important point, and it really highlights the need for designers to think carefully about the needs and preferences of their target audience.<br><br>
            
        I also appreciated the emphasis on testing and iterating on game designs based on user feedback. This user-centered approach can really help ensure that the game meets the needs and expectations of its audience, and can ultimately lead to a more successful and enjoyable game experience.<br><br>
            
        Overall, I found the article to be a really valuable resource for anyone interested in game design or UX. By incorporating these best practices into their designs, designers can create games that are not only fun and engaging, but also intuitive and user-friendly. Thanks for reading!<br><br></p>

        <article><h1>Post #4: Visual Thinking Analysis</h1>
        <img src="IMG_7465.JPG" alt="Tatcha Skin Care">
        <p>The photo above depicts one of my photos that I am thinking of using for the Every Picture Project. As someone who loves taking care of my skin, I can't help but sing the praises of Tatcha as a brand. In my experience, their skincare products are truly top-notch and have made a noticeable difference in the appearance and overall health of my skin.

        What I appreciate most about Tatcha is the quality of their ingredients. They use natural, high-quality ingredients that are gentle on the skin but still deliver results. For example, their use of Japanese rice bran, green tea, and algae has left my skin feeling nourished and hydrated in a way that other products simply can't match.<br><br>
            
        Another thing that I love about Tatcha is the simplicity of their product line. Rather than bombarding you with countless products, they offer a carefully curated selection that's designed to work together seamlessly. This has made it easy for me to build a personalized skincare routine that actually works for my skin.<br><br></p>
        
        <img src="guopei1002.JPEG" alt="Guo Pei Exhibit" width="303" height="404">
        <p>This photo above depicts one of my photos that my peer, Cindy Lee, is thinking of using for the Every Picture Project. From what I've seen in the SF Legion of Arts Museum, this photo is taken from the Guo Pei Exhibit. The Guo Pei museum is significant because it showcases the extraordinary talent and creativity of one of China's most celebrated fashion designers. Guo Pei's designs are renowned for their intricate details, elaborate embellishments, and the use of traditional Chinese techniques and materials.<br><br>
            
        Her work has been worn by celebrities and featured in international fashion shows, but the museum offers a unique opportunity to see these stunning pieces up close and in person. In addition to the sheer beauty of the designs, the museum also provides a glimpse into the cultural and historical significance of Guo Pei's work, making it an important cultural institution for anyone interested in fashion or Chinese art and history.<br><br></p>
        
        <article><h1>Post #3: Visual Thinking Strategies Research
        </h1>
        <p>The article "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" published on the New York Times Learning Network blog in 2015, is a great resource for teachers looking to engage their students in close reading and visual thinking activities. The author presents 10 thought-provoking photographs along with discussion questions and prompts that encourage students to analyze and interpret the visual elements and themes within the images.<br><br>

        What's great about this article is that it showcases the power of visual media as a teaching tool. By using photographs, teachers can help students develop critical thinking skills and improve their ability to read and interpret visual information. The article also emphasizes the importance of using open-ended questions to encourage students to think creatively and come up with their own interpretations of the images.<br><br>
            
        Overall, the article is a great example of how educators can use visual media to create engaging and interactive learning experiences for their students. By incorporating visual thinking and close reading activities into their curriculum, teachers can help their students become more perceptive and analytical thinkers, and develop a deeper appreciation for the power of visual media.<br><br></p>
        
        <article><h1>Post #2: Best Practices for Modals Response
        </h1>
        <p>Naema Basknderi's article on modal best practices reexamines its UI flaws. UI issues were elegantly solved when modal windows first appeared on the scene. The first is that it streamlines the user interface, and the second is that it conserves screen space. Since then, the modal window has been widely used by designers, some of whom have gone overboard. Today's equivalent of the dreaded pop-up window is a modal. Users have been educated to dismiss modal windows out of habit because they find them unpleasant.</p>

        <p>It was interested to see that mobile devices and modals typically don't get along. Modals either take up too much screen space or are too small, making it impossible to see the content. Users are forced to pinch and zoom in order to see the fields of a modal window when the device keyboard and nested scrollbars are added. Modals are not appropriate for use on mobile devices and have superior alternatives.</p>
            
        <p>Overall, I learned that modals have many advantages, such as drawing the user's attention, maintaining context, and streamlining the user interface. However, there are drawbacks since they obstruct user flow and prevent interaction with the parent page by concealing the information behind the modal. Modal might not always be the best choice. When choosing whether to use a Modal, it's best to take into account when to show it, how to show it, and what information is going to be presented.</p>
