        <article><h1>Post #2: Best Practices for Modals Response
        </h1>
        <p>Naema Basknderi's article on modal best practices reexamines its UI flaws. UI issues were elegantly solved when modal windows first appeared on the scene. The first is that it streamlines the user interface, and the second is that it conserves screen space. Since then, the modal window has been widely used by designers, some of whom have gone overboard. Today's equivalent of the dreaded pop-up window is a modal. Users have been educated to dismiss modal windows out of habit because they find them unpleasant.</p>

        <p>It was interested to see that mobile devices and modals typically don't get along. Modals either take up too much screen space or are too small, making it impossible to see the content. Users are forced to pinch and zoom in order to see the fields of a modal window when the device keyboard and nested scrollbars are added. Modals are not appropriate for use on mobile devices and have superior alternatives.</p>
            
        <p>Overall, I learned that modals have many advantages, such as drawing the user's attention, maintaining context, and streamlining the user interface. However, there are drawbacks since they obstruct user flow and prevent interaction with the parent page by concealing the information behind the modal. Modal might not always be the best choice. When choosing whether to use a Modal, it's best to take into account when to show it, how to show it, and what information is going to be presented.</p>
