            <h1>Project Summary</h1>
            <p>For my final project, I'm incredibly excited to be expanding my Game of Pig to be a more interactive, cookoff-style version of the classic game.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p> My goals for the final project are to create an all-around immersive, fun experience for the user where they can't even question if the game was made scrappily by a student. Since the Game of Pig is a multiplayer game, I decided to theme my final game on one of my favorite multiplayer games: OverCooked. I love cooking games where multiple players battle off and cook some common at-home dishes, and what better way to pay homage to my love for cooking than with a cooking Game of Pig! The concept of the game will likely be fairly simple to the original game, where each player will roll dice and have ranomdly-generated results, however, I want to add some spice to it.
            </p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>Articulate your plans for the overall look and feel (visual strategies, such as formal details including color and type). Use language that includes design elements, design principles and Gestalt.

            In terms of visual design, I want all graphic / icon elements to be extremely cute and consist of rounded shapes. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>Articulate your plans for interactions, including time-based behaviors, visual and aural feedback, inputs, etc.


            </p>
            
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>Articulate your goals for intended/desired experiences for the users and how you plan to achieve them.

            I hope every user playing this game has a smile on their face, and anticipates the cute little interactions of the food icons / cooking icons. 
            </p>
