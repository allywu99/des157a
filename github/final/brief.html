            <h1>Project Summary</h1>
            <p>For my final project, I'm incredibly excited to be expanding my Game of Pig to be a more interactive, cookoff-style version of the classic game.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p> My goals for the final project are to create an all-around immersive, fun experience for the user where they can't even question if the game was made scrappily by a student. Since the Game of Pig is a multiplayer game, I decided to theme my final game on one of my favorite multiplayer games: OverCooked. I love cooking games where multiple players battle off and cook some common at-home dishes, and what better way to pay homage to my love for cooking than with a cooking Game of Pig! The concept of the game will likely be fairly simple to the original game, where each player will roll dice and have ranomdly-generated results, however, I want to add some spice to it.
            </p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>In terms of visual design, I want all graphic / icon elements to be extremely cute and consist of rounded shapes, similar to the style of the characters from OverCooked. All of the characters in that game are in the "chibi" style of artwork that I really love. I also want all of the food icons to appear like emojis. I would love for the typography to emulate a "diner" or vintage breakfast restaurant feel. But at the same time, I want it to feel very much like an 8-bit pixel art game.  
            </p>
            
            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>In terms of interactions, I want both players to enter a name for their chefs, to give it a bit of a personal touch. Next, I want the players to fully understand the game rules by having a mandatory tutorial popup. Next, I want the players to be able to choose which breakfast food item they want to cook. I will allow them to choose from 5 different items, or they can have the game randomly pick the breakfast food for them. In terms of audio and feedback, every hover item will have a sound effect attached to it, and will also have a different cursor to help indicate that it's interact-able. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>I hope every user playing this game has a smile on their face, and anticipates the cute little interactions of the food icons / cooking icons. I also want there to be an actual level of skill to the game as well, where both players either have to use mouse positioning or some sort of movement to gain points, rather than have the rolls be all random. This level of competition may not be feasible to complete by the final, but we'll see how far I get!
